# ME-385-Robotics

## Overview

This repository contains the course material of **ME-385 Robotics**, 2021 Spring @ SJTU, taught by [Prof Ye Ding](https://me.sjtu.edu.cn/en/FullTimeTeacher/dingye.html). The contents include lecture slides, assignments, solutions, and quizzes.

## Course Description

This course is a professional elective of mechanical specialty. This curriculum mainly aims at systematically introduce the basic theoretical knowledge of robotics, robot design, robot control, and robot programming knowledge to the students. The course content will cover topics from **Rigid Body Motion, Robot Kinematics and Dynamics based on Standard D-H description, Robot Kinematics and Dynamics based on POE formula (Lie Theory), Path and Trajectory Planning, and Robot Motion Control**. The homework assignments are mainly accomplished by MATLAB coding.

## Textbooks

Robotics: Modelling, Planning and Control - by Bruno Siciliano, Lorenzo Sciavicco, Luigi Villani and Giuseppe Oriolo

A Mathematical Introduction to Robotic Manipulation by Richard M. Murray, Zexiang Li and S. Shankar Sastry

Modern Robotics: Mechanics, Planning and Control by Kevin M. Lynch and Frank C. Park

Robotics, Vision and Control by Peter Corke

## Format

Each lecture (chapter) will correspond to a file folder. Each file folder usually contains three subfolders.

**<u>Slides</u>**:

The lecture slides.

**<u>Quizzes</u>**: 

The quizzes held at the beginning of each lecture, usually last for 5-10 minutes, act as a review and test for understanding the course content.

**<u>Assignments</u>**: 

The homework assignment for the XXth lecture, including 

**problem description** (file name: "机器人学第XX次作业")

**my solution texts** (file name: "RhwXX\_黄韦程\_518020910178")

**src** (my source code. i.e., m file for each problem)

**Figs** (Figures plotted and used)

**assignment feedbacks** (file name: "机器人学第XX次作业 解题思路与常见问题")

**standard/reference solutions** (file name: "第XX次作业 优秀作业范例")



***<u>Notes:</u>**: 

Apart from the lecture slides, most materials are in Chinese. I may translate some of the code comments into English in the future for better understanding. If you find my solutions or codes wrong or need to be improved, welcome to leave a message, and I will appreciate it a lot!

## *Other Statement

*The copyrights of all the lecture slides are owed by Prof Ye Ding.

*The copyrights of all the assignments, quizzes, and solutions (including feedbacks) are owed by Prof Ye Ding and the course TA Tengyu Hou and Pengsheng Huang.

I will gradually upload the related files (codes and my solutions) as time goes on. It may take quite  long time since many of my past files are poorly organized in my current view, and I may make some modifications and comments before uploading.
